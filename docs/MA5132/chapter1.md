# Permutations and Combinatorics

## Permutation formulae

- Permutation of n objects with duplicates
 
$$
N = \frac{n!}{p!q!r!\ldots}
$$

- Circular Permutation

**Strategy:** Fix one of the objects and permute the rest. Alternatively, permute the ring as normal but divide by N at the end, due to the N-order symmetry.

$$
N = (n-1)!
$$


## Probability relations

- Independence: $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
- Mutually exclusive: $P(A \cap B) = 0$
- Conditional probability (Probability of A given B):
 
$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
